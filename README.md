**Personal Portofilo Website - Build with Bootstrap Icons, Bulma, mdsvex and SvelteKit**

:sparkles: Special thanks to [Josh Collinsworth](https://joshcollinsworth.com/) for providing the very nice and detailed blog post _"[Let's learn SvelteKit by building a static Markdown blog from scratch](https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/build-static-sveltekit-markdown-blog)"_. It helped me a lot to create this page.

## Developing

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Don't forget to install all dependencies using `npm i`.

```bash
# Start a local development server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building and Previewing

:warning: Before creating a production version of your app, install an adapter for your target environment.

```bash
npm run build

# Preview the built app
npm run preview
```
